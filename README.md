Service scripts for built-in mac [automator](https://support.apple.com/guide/automator/welcome/mac) app. Services are "scripts" of sorts that you can trigger when right-clicking on the appropriate context (such as highlighted text or a file in finder).

To "install" a given service simply double-click the outer "<name>.workflow" file and it will open in automator and prompt you to install it.

#### Resize image to 1920
Right-click an image and resize it to 1920 x (whatever keeps the ration constant). Is useful when you have an image you might want to upload to a website. The vast majority of screens will dedicate less than 1920 pixels to any given image, and by reducing the pixel count you significantly reduce the size.

#### Extract Email Addresses.workflow
Right-click a section of highlighted text and extract all things that look like email adresses from it.
